# Smart Job & Skill Recommendation System

## Overview
The **Smart Job & Skill Recommendation System** is a web application developed using **Streamlit**, which utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to provide personalized job recommendations. It helps users find relevant job roles based on their skills, job roles based on the skills required, and even recommends jobs based on the skills extracted from an uploaded resume.

This system aims to assist job seekers in finding the most suitable job opportunities and skill requirements by analyzing the content provided by the user, including text-based input (skills, job roles) and resume uploads (PDF/TXT).

---

## Features:
### 1. **Job Recommendations Based on Skills**
   - Users can input their skills (comma-separated), and the system will recommend jobs that match those skills.
   - The application calculates the similarity between the user input and job listings using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity**.

### 2. **Skill Recommendations for Job Roles**
   - Users can enter a specific job role (e.g., "Data Scientist", "Web Developer"), and the system will suggest the most relevant skills for that role.
   - The application compares the user input with job titles and identifies common skills associated with similar job positions.

### 3. **Resume Upload for Personalized Job Recommendations**
   - Users can upload their **resume** (in **PDF** or **TXT** format).
   - The system extracts the text from the resume, analyzes the skills mentioned in it, and recommends jobs based on those skills.
   - Skills are extracted by comparing resume text with a pre-defined list of common technical and soft skills.

### 4. **Interactive UI (Built with Streamlit)**
   - A user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the system easily by entering their skills, job roles, or uploading resumes.
   - The interface is designed to provide quick and personalized feedback, showing recommended job roles or required skills for the specified job role.

### 5. **Skills Extraction from Text**
   - The application includes an algorithm to extract **skills** from both user input and uploaded resume text using **simple keyword matching**.
   - A predefined list of skills (e.g., Python, SQL, Machine Learning, etc.) is used to match the text content and extract the skills mentioned.

---

## Use Cases:
1. **Job Seekers**: 
   - A person looking for a job can input their skills and get a list of recommended job openings.
   - Alternatively, they can upload their resume to get job recommendations based on the extracted skills from their document.

2. **Career Development**:
   - A user can enter a job role they are interested in (e.g., "Data Scientist") to receive a list of key skills required for that role.
   - This is particularly useful for people who want to upskill or transition to a new role by knowing which skills are in demand.

3. **HR Professionals**:
   - HR personnel or recruiters can use the system to find candidates based on the skills listed in job descriptions or resumes.

4. **Educational Institutions**:
   - Colleges or career counseling centers can leverage the system to help students understand what skills are needed for various job roles.

---

## Application:
The Smart Job & Skill Recommendation System has wide applications in:
- **Job Search Platforms**: Integrating the system into job portals to provide personalized job recommendations.
- **Resume Screening**: Using resume parsing to automate the process of matching candidate skills to job listings.
- **Personal Career Guidance**: Offering career advice and skill improvement recommendations.
- **Recruitment Tools**: Assisting recruiters in finding candidates with the right skillset by analyzing resumes.

## How to Use:

### Prerequisites:
1. **Python 3.7 or higher** is required to run the application.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn PyMuPDF
    ```

### Steps to Run the Application:
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-job-skill-recommendation-system.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd smart-job-skill-recommendation-system
    ```
3. **Run the Streamlit app**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. This will launch the app in your browser, where you can interact with the following features:
   - **Job Recommendations by Skills**: Enter comma-separated skills (e.g., Python, SQL) and click on the **Find Jobs** button to get job recommendations.
   - **Skills for Job Roles**: Enter a job role (e.g., Data Scientist) and click **Find Skills** to see the most relevant skills for that role.
   - **Upload Resume for Recommendations**: Upload your resume (PDF or TXT format), and the system will analyze the document to extract skills and provide job suggestions based on the extracted skills.

### Key Inputs:
- **Skills Input**: Comma-separated list of skills (e.g., "Python, Machine Learning, SQL").
- **Job Role Input**: Name of the job role (e.g., "Data Scientist").
- **Resume Upload**: Upload a **PDF** or **TXT** file containing your resume. The system will extract skills and recommend jobs based on that.
